To play in INSTEAD games just see *tutorial* that is included with INSTEAD.
Then download any game and play it.

Some delelopers documentation is included in INSTEAD. English documentation is sadly outdated.
You also can download the game: Dive into INSTEAD (for developers) (on [games](/games) page), and examine its code.

Some resources for Developers:
