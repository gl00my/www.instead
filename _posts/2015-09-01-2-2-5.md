INSTEAD 2.2.5 is out. This is bugfix only release and it
fixes a lot of bugs in Windows version and others SDL2 builds. 
So update is highly recommended!

Changes are:

  * fix bug with SDL2 and idf format (segfault);
  * fix bug with SDL2 windows build (cursor coordinates);
  * fix some bugs with SDL2;
  * fix bug with music paused while run fullscreen mode;

Binary builds will be available as soon as they are ready.
