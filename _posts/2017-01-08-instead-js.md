Merry Christmas!

I am glad to tell you, that we have new INSTEAD versions here!

First of all, it is INSTEAD-JS by technix (instead running in web). Source code can be
found at [instead-hub](https://github.com/instead-hub).

You can try some games right now: [https://instead-hub.github.io/instead-js/](https://instead-hub.github.io/instead-js/)

And another one is PlainInstead by Anton Lastochkin. INSTEAD for the visually impaired people.
This version also can be found in [instead-hub](https://github.com/instead-hub).

Thank you! And stay tuned. We are working hard on the next release of INSTEAD!
