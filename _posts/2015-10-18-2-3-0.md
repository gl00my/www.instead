INSTEAD 2.3.0 is out. A lot of bugs were fixed and gfx mode selection
algorithm was rewritten. So update is highly recommended! By the way,
Antokolos will release new Android port soon -- INSTEAD-NG, this port
will be the official android port of INSTEAD. Stay tuned!

Changes are:

  * audio is 44100 by default now;
  * Windows segfault (long paths);
  * lua: visits/visited -> stead.visits, stead.visited;
  * fix in -nosound (zero volume bug);
  * fix of critical bug in fingers module;
  * a lot of fixes for upcoming Android version;
  * SDL2: better screenmodes handling;
  * SDL2: fix of blended bg;
  * -resizable option (resizable window, SDL2 only);
  * some memory leaks were fixed;

Binary builds will be available as soon as they are ready.
